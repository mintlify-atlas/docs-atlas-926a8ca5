## Welcome to Pi

Pi is a comprehensive toolkit for building AI agents with full control over your workflows. From a flagship interactive coding agent CLI to low-level APIs for custom implementations, Pi gives you the building blocks to create intelligent, tool-using applications.

**Key Philosophy:** Aggressively extensible. Features that other tools bake in can be built with extensions, skills, or installed from third-party packages. This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape Pi to fit how you work.

## What's Included

Pi is a monorepo containing seven packages, each solving a specific problem in the AI agent stack:

## Core Features

### Unified LLM Access

Work with any LLM provider through a single, consistent API:

- **15+ Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, xAI, Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter, and more
- **Automatic Discovery**: Models and capabilities detected automatically
- **Tool Calling**: TypeBox-validated function calling across all providers
- **Cross-Provider Handoffs**: Switch models mid-conversation while preserving context
- **OAuth Support**: Built-in support for subscription-based services (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, GitHub Copilot)

### Agent Building Blocks

Build custom agents with minimal boilerplate:

- **Event-Driven**: Subscribe to agent lifecycle events for real-time UI updates
- **Tool Execution**: Automatic validation and error handling for tool calls
- **State Management**: Built-in message history and context management
- **Steering & Follow-up**: Interrupt agents mid-execution or queue follow-up tasks
- **Transport Abstraction**: Run agents over HTTP, WebSocket, or in-process

### Terminal & Web UIs

Pre-built components for both terminal and browser:

- **Terminal**: Editor, markdown renderer, select lists, loaders, overlays
- **Web**: Chat panels, artifact viewers, file attachments, session management
- **Themes**: Customizable styling for both environments
- **Differential Rendering**: Efficient updates with no flicker

## Design Principles

<Note>
  **Minimal Core, Maximum Extensibility:** Pi deliberately omits features like sub-agents, plan mode, and permission popups from the core. Instead, these can be built as extensions, installed from packages, or implemented however fits your workflow. This keeps the foundation small and fast while enabling infinite customization.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **No Lock-in:** Context and messages are plain JSON. Switch between models mid-conversation. Use different providers for different tasks. Pi doesn't force you into a single provider or workflow.
</Tip>
