title: Creating Agent Skills
description: Build self-contained capability packages with specialized workflows and reference documentation
---

Skills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.

Pi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), ensuring compatibility with other agent harnesses like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Create Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill
cd ~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill
```

### Write SKILL.md

Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

## Setup

Run once before first use:

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill && npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/process.sh <input>
```

See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.
```

### Test the Skill

```bash
pi
```

The skill appears in the system prompt automatically. Use `/skill:my-skill` to load it explicitly.

</Steps>

## How Skills Work

1. At startup, Pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions
2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format
3. When a task matches, the agent uses the `read` tool to load the full SKILL.md
4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets

This is **progressive disclosure**: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.

## Skill Structure

A complete skill directory:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── process.sh
├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   └── api-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

### SKILL.md Format

The only required file. Must include:

1. **YAML frontmatter** with `name` and `description`
2. **Markdown content** with instructions

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent go here.
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Must match parent directory. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental). |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |

### Name Rules

- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
- Must match parent directory name

**Valid:** `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`

**Invalid:** `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ```yaml
    description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poor">
    ```yaml
    description: Helps with PDFs.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Complete Example

<Steps>

### Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/skills/brave-search
cd ~/.pi/agent/skills/brave-search
```

### Add Scripts

Create `search.js`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const query = process.argv[2];
const includeContent = process.argv.includes('--content');

// Search implementation
const results = await searchBrave(query, { includeContent });
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x search.js
```

### Write SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---

# Brave Search

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent/skills/brave-search && npm install
export BRAVE_API_KEY=your-key
```

## Search

```bash
./search.js "query"              # Basic search
./search.js "query" --content    # Include page content
```

## Extract Page Content

```bash
./content.js https://example.com
```
```

### Test It

```bash
pi
```

Then ask:

```
Search for "TypeScript best practices"
```

</Steps>

## Skill Locations

Pi loads skills from:

- **Global:**
  - `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
  - `~/.agents/skills/`
- **Project:**
  - `.pi/skills/`
  - `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root)
- **Packages:** `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`
- **Settings:** `skills` array with files or directories
- **CLI:** `--skill <path>` (repeatable)

### Using Skills from Other Harnesses

To use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.claude/skills",
    "~/.codex/skills"
  ]
}
```

For project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": ["../.claude/skills"]
}
```

## Skill Commands

Skills register as `/skill:name` commands:

```bash
/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute
/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load with arguments
```

Arguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.

Toggle via `/settings` or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enableSkillCommands": true
}
```

## Relative Paths

Use relative paths from the skill directory:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
```

Pi resolves these paths relative to the skill's base directory.

## Validation

Pi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard:

- Name doesn't match parent directory → Warning
- Name exceeds 64 characters → Warning
- Name contains invalid characters → Warning
- Description exceeds 1024 characters → Warning
- Missing description → Skill not loaded

Name collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.

## Dynamic Skills from Extensions

Extensions can provide skills dynamically:

```typescript
import type { ExtensionAPI, Skill } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent";

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  const skill: Skill = {
    name: "dynamic-skill",
    description: "Skill provided by extension",
    content: "# Dynamic Skill\n\nInstructions here.",
    source: "extension",
  };

  pi.on("resources_discover", async (event) => {
    return {
      skills: [skill],
    };
  });
}
```

See `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/dynamic-resources/` for a complete example.
