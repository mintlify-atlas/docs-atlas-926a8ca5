<Note>
Pi can create skills for you. Just ask it to build one for your use case.
</Note>

Skills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.

Pi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about violations but remaining lenient.

## How Skills Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    At startup, Pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System Prompt">
    Available skills are included in the system prompt in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="On-Demand Loading">
    When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md
    
    (Models don't always do this automatically - use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execution">
    The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is **progressive disclosure**: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.

## Skill Locations

<Warning>
Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code. Review skill content before use.
</Warning>

Pi loads skills from:

**Global:**
- `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
- `~/.agents/skills/`

**Project:**
- `.pi/skills/`
- `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root)

**Packages:**
- `skills/` directories in pi packages
- `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`

**Settings:**
- `skills` array with files or directories

**CLI:**
- `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)

### Discovery Rules

- Direct `.md` files in the skills directory root
- Recursive `SKILL.md` files under subdirectories

Disable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).

### Using Skills from Other Harnesses

To use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.claude/skills",
    "~/.codex/skills"
  ]
}
```

For project-level Claude Code skills:

```json
{
  "skills": ["../.claude/skills"]
}
```

## Skill Commands

Skills register as `/skill:name` commands:

```bash
/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill
/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments
```

Arguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.

**Toggle skill commands:**

  <Tab title="Interactive">
    Use `/settings` to toggle skill commands
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="settings.json">
    ```json
    {
      "enableSkillCommands": true
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Skill Structure

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── process.sh
├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   └── api-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

## Setup

Run once before first use:
\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm install
\`\`\`

## Usage

\`\`\`bash
./scripts/process.sh <input>
\`\`\`
```

**Use relative paths** from the skill directory:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.
```

## Frontmatter

Per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Must match parent directory.
  
  **Valid:** `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`
  
  **Invalid:** `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string" required>
  Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it.
  
  **Be specific** - this determines when the agent loads the skill.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="license" type="string">
  License name or reference to bundled file
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="compatibility" type="string">
  Max 500 chars. Environment requirements
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="metadata" type="object">
  Arbitrary key-value mapping
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="allowed-tools" type="string">
  Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="disable-model-invocation" type="boolean">
  When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`
</ParamField>

### Name Rules

- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
- Must match parent directory name

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when the agent loads the skill. **Be specific.**

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Good
---
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.
---
```

```markdown Poor
---
description: Helps with PDFs.
---
```
</CodeGroup>

## Validation

Pi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:

- Name doesn't match parent directory
- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters
- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens
- Description exceeds 1024 characters

Unknown frontmatter fields are ignored.

**Exception:** Skills with missing description are not loaded.

Name collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.

## Example Skill

Complete example: `brave-search/`

```
brave-search/
├── SKILL.md
├── search.js
└── content.js
```

**SKILL.md:**

```markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---

# Brave Search

## Setup

\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/brave-search && npm install
\`\`\`

## Search

\`\`\`bash
./search.js "query"              # Basic search
./search.js "query" --content    # Include page content
\`\`\`

## Extract Page Content

\`\`\`bash
./content.js https://example.com
\`\`\`
```

The agent can now:
1. Read the skill when needed
2. Run setup if required
3. Execute searches using the documented commands
4. Reference the scripts with relative paths

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write clear descriptions">
    The description is the most important part. It tells the agent when to use the skill.
    
    Include:
    - What the skill does
    - When to use it
    - What problems it solves
    
    Avoid:
    - Vague descriptions
    - Generic terms
    - Missing use cases
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document setup clearly">
    If the skill requires setup (npm install, API keys, etc.), document it clearly in a Setup section.
    
    The agent should be able to:
    - Detect if setup is needed
    - Run setup commands
    - Verify setup succeeded
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use relative paths">
    Always use paths relative to the skill directory:
    
    ```markdown
    ./scripts/process.sh
    [Reference](references/api.md)
    ```
    
    This ensures the skill works regardless of where it's installed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include examples">
    Show concrete examples of how to use the skill:
    
    ```markdown
    ## Example
    
    Search for Node.js documentation:
    \`\`\`bash
    ./search.js "node.js async/await"
    \`\`\`
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide reference docs">
    For complex skills, include detailed reference documentation that the agent can load on-demand:
    
    ```
    my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Quick start
    └── references/
        ├── API.md        # Detailed API docs
        └── EXAMPLES.md   # More examples
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sharing Skills

Package skills for others to use:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create package.json">
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-skills",
      "keywords": ["pi-package", "agent-skills"],
      "pi": {
        "skills": ["./skills"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish">
    ```bash
    npm publish
    ```
    
    Or push to GitHub for git-based installation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Users Install">
    ```bash
    pi install npm:my-skills
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
