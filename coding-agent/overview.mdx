---

Pi is a minimal terminal coding harness that adapts to your workflows through TypeScript extensions, Agent Skills, prompt templates, and themes. Instead of forcing you into a specific workflow, Pi provides powerful defaults and lets you customize everything.

## What Makes Pi Different

Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips opinionated features like sub-agents and plan mode. Instead, you can:

- **Ask pi to build what you want** - Pi can create extensions for your specific workflow
- **Install third-party packages** - Use npm or git to share and install extensions
- **Customize without forking** - Extend functionality through well-defined APIs

## Operating Modes

Pi runs in four modes to fit different use cases:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Interactive" icon="terminal" iconType="solid">
    Full TUI with editor, commands, keyboard shortcuts, and visual feedback
  </Card>
  <Card title="Print" icon="print" iconType="solid">
    One-shot mode that prints response and exits (`-p` flag)
  </Card>
  <Card title="JSON" icon="code" iconType="solid">
    Event stream output for scripting (`--mode json`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="RPC" icon="plug" iconType="solid">
    Process integration via stdin/stdout (`--mode rpc`)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
```

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pi
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
pi
/login  # Then select provider
```

## Core Features

### Built-in Tools

By default, pi gives the model four essential tools:

- **`read`** - Read file contents
- **`write`** - Create new files
- **`edit`** - Modify existing files with precise replacements
- **`bash`** - Execute shell commands

Optional tools available via `--tools` flag:
- **`grep`** - Search file contents
- **`find`** - Find files by pattern
- **`ls`** - List directory contents

### Providers & Models

Pi supports multiple providers through subscriptions or API keys:

**Subscriptions (via `/login`):**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro
- GitHub Copilot
- Google Gemini CLI
- Google Antigravity

**API Keys:**
- Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI
- Google Gemini, Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, Groq
- Cerebras, xAI, OpenRouter
- And many more...

See the [CLI Reference](/coding-agent/cli-reference) for all providers.

### Session Management

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure, enabling:

- **In-place branching** - Explore different conversation paths without creating new files
- **Time travel** - Navigate to any point in the conversation tree via `/tree`
- **Automatic compaction** - Summarize old messages when context grows too large
- **Resume anywhere** - Continue previous sessions with `/resume` or `-c` flag

### Extensibility

Pi's extensibility system lets you customize everything:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Extensions" icon="puzzle-piece">
    TypeScript modules that add tools, commands, UI, and event handlers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Skills" icon="book">
    On-demand capability packages following the Agent Skills standard
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompt Templates" icon="file-lines">
    Reusable prompts as Markdown files with variable substitution
  </Card>
  <Card title="Themes" icon="palette">
    JSON files that customize TUI colors and appearance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Philosophy

Pi is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with extensions or installed from third-party packages. This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape pi to fit how you work.

**No MCP** - Build CLI tools with READMEs (see Skills), or build an extension that adds MCP support.

**No sub-agents** - Spawn pi instances via tmux, or build your own with extensions, or install a package.

**No permission popups** - Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with extensions.

**No plan mode** - Write plans to files, or build it with extensions, or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos** - They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with extensions.

**No background bash** - Use tmux for full observability and direct interaction.

## Example Usage

<CodeGroup>
```bash Interactive
# Start interactive session
pi "List all TypeScript files in src/"

# Continue most recent session
pi -c

# Browse and select from past sessions
pi -r
```

```bash Print Mode
# One-shot response
pi -p "Summarize this codebase"

# With file context
pi -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"

# Read-only mode
pi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"
```

```bash Different Models
# Specify provider and model
pi --provider openai --model gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with provider prefix
pi --model openai/gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with thinking level
pi --model sonnet:high "Solve this complex problem"
```
</CodeGroup>
